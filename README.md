These are course materials (slides turned webpage) for a class I taught at Georg-August-University GÃ¶ttingen in 2019/2020, dealing mainly with an introduction to R and inferential statistics. All materials (except for a few english comments which survived the editing stage) in German.

Material was created using R Markdown.
